            maintain interest in it. The main goal now is to form a client base and beat competitors. And then it will be
            possible to raise prices for paid services and increase their number. Dominate on the market tomorrow is more
            important than making a profit today. The connection of new services, flexible pricing policy and the opportunities
            for deep modernization of the site will help us to always be in a trend.</p>

            20% of the company's profits, sell tokens on crypto-exchange exchanges and profit from the increase in the cost
            of tokens.</p>

          <p class="item">The mechanism for the payment of profits and distribution of shares will be prescribed in the company's
            Charter, and the distribution will be performed through a smart-contract for Waves.</p>
